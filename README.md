# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data.

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and treatment. This project uses various ML algorithms to analyze patient data and classify the risk of heart disease.




## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical measurements.
